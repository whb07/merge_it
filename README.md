## Merge It - A simple Rust implementation

This simple lib implements a quick version of mergesort. It uses some of the traits/generics built in for Rust, letting the compiler generate the 
specific functions needed for the concrete types its is being called for. For example, the test cases have unsigned ints, signed ints, and strings
being sorted.

## To Run
In the root directory:
